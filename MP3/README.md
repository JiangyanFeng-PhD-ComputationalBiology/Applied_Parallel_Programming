# MP3: Tiled Matrix Multiplication

Implementing a tiled dense matrix multiplication routine using shared memory

## The code performs the following:
* Allocate device memory
* Copy host memory to device
* Initialize thread block and kernel grid dimensions
* Invoke CUDA kernel
* Copy results from device to host
* Deallocate device memory
* Implement the matrix-matrix multiplication routine using shared memory and tiling
