# MP4: 3D Convolution

Implementing a 3D convolution using constant memory for the kernel and 3D shared memory tiling

## The code performs the following:
* Implement a 3D convolution with a 3x3x3 kernel in constant memory and a 3D shared-memory tiling
* Launch 3D CUDA grid and blocks, where each thread is responsible for computing a single element of the output
